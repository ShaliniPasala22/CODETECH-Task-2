# Simple Linear Regression Model

This project implements a *Simple Linear Regression* model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The dataset used is a synthetic one, where the target variable has a linear relationship with the feature. The model is trained, evaluated, and visualized to assess its performance.

## Key Features:
- *Data Generation*: Generates a synthetic dataset with a linear relationship between the feature and target variable, with added noise.
- *Data Splitting*: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- *Model Training*: A simple linear regression model is trained using the training data.
- *Model Evaluation: Performance is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)* and *R-squared* metrics.
- *Visualization*: 
  - Regression line fitted on the training data.
  - Actual vs. predicted values comparison to assess the model's accuracy visually.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
